- When it is compiled to an exe on a fresh system, the executable size is around 80 megabytes. When I was compiling it on my development git, it compiled to about 30 megabytes. Is there a reason why a fresh git clone would produce an 80 megabyte executable, versus the 30 megabyte in the development environment. Or are we doing something to not optimize the output? are there any improvements we can make to the quality and speed of the code? 

- Update so we can only run one instance of this application on the system at the same time. We should also be producing some errors or warnings if the port is already used. 

- The global key presses aren't as reactive or responsive as I thought they would be I mean they do respond but sometimes to stop a recording you have to hit it a few times like it's almost like you're missing it like it's only reading it once every so many times a second that should be instant. And it's important that the keyboard controls react, cause the application to react immediately. It's not like there's a major problem, I think something needs a minor tweak. 

- If these items still to be processed and we have hit pause, then the visual animations will continue. I think we should change the colour of the animations to indicate that we are still processing but we are about to stop. I also want, if you press the key again, to reverse the pause and just to me to cancel the pause and just to carry on recording as if you had a hit pause in the first place. 

- When the output mode is updated, the visual animation style doesn't change. We have to stop the recording, then start the recording again for that to update that needs to be dynamic based on the menu option or or whatever.
